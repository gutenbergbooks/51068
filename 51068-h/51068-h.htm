<p>&ldquo;Oh ranger, please! Just one itzy bitzy
piece of petrified wood to take home to show
my boy friend. You won&rsquo;t miss just one
teeny weeny piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding in his hand an assortment of specimens
of petrified wood which he had just
retrieved from the young lady driving the
flashy convertible, the Highway 260 checking
station ranger at Petrified Forest National
Monument shook his head with a wry smile.
&ldquo;Sorry, lady, but the rules say &lsquo;It is unlawful
to injure, destroy, or remove specimens of
petrified wood of any size whatsoever found
within the monument boundary * * *,&rsquo; and
my job is to see that this and other regulations
are obeyed. You&rsquo;re right, we would
never miss these few pieces if you took them
home with you, but they belong to the people
of the United States, and if everyone of the
350,000 visitors who come here each year
took away only a few specimens, as you wish
to do, in a very few years there wouldn&rsquo;t be
any left. It&rsquo;s my job, as representative of the
people of this country, to see that there will
always be this great natural display of petrified
wood here where it was formed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the young lady drove off with a gay
wave of her hand and &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re mean&rdquo;
tossed over her shoulder, the ranger turned
to us with a rueful smile. &ldquo;Happens every
day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame people for
wanting to take home a souvenir of the Petrified
Forest, and the stuff is so pretty that kids,
especially, just can&rsquo;t help but want to pack
it off. And, with so much of it here, it&rsquo;s hard
for them to understand that it would soon be
gone, particularly along the roads and trails,
if everyone carried off a handful or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We agreed with the ranger that it is hard
to understand, until it is explained that such
enormous quantities of petrified wood as are
strewn over hundreds of acres in Petrified
Forest National Monument could be entirely
removed in a few years by souvenir-hungry
American tourists. &ldquo;But where,&rdquo; we inquired,
&ldquo;do these roadside stands all along Highway
66 get the huge piles of petrified wood which
they offer for sale? Surely the National Park
Service doesn&rsquo;t permit them to haul it off the
monument by the truckload.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; grinned the ranger. &ldquo;All of that
&lsquo;for-sale&rsquo; wood comes from private lands. The
national monument preserves and protects
only the largest and most colorful deposits of
petrified wood; but it is found in many places
throughout northeastern Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impatient toot of an automobile horn
informed us that we were blocking traffic, so
we thanked the ranger and continued on our
way. However, the interesting conversation
aroused our curiosity, and at the first opportunity
we returned to the Petrified Forest to
learn more about the occurrence of petrified
wood, and how Uncle Sam, through the
National Park Service, keeps the wood from
being carried off by souvenir collectors, and
how the fascinating story of wood petrification
is told to visitors who take a little time
to visit the monument museum at the Rainbow
Forest headquarters of the superintendent.
This is the way the naturalists tell it.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it was the threat of souvenir
hunters and raids on the fields of petrified
wood by commercial jewelers, gem collectors,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and abrasive manufacturers in the late 1890&rsquo;s
and early 1900&rsquo;s that led thoughtful citizens
of the then Arizona Territory to petition
Congress for the establishment of some sort
of a protectorate for the Petrified Forest. In
the vicinity of the Agate Bridge and what is
now known as the First Forest, enterprising
abrasive makers set up a stamp mill to pulverize
the great blocks of petrified wood
which they found there. Here, also, many of
the logs were dynamited in the search for
quartz and amethyst crystals which some of
them contained.</p>
<p>As a result of the petition by citizens of
Arizona Territory, and in response to requests
by other groups in the Southwest that
steps be taken to protect great cliff dwellings
and other prehistoric Indian remains which
were being systematically pothunted and
looted, Congress passed the Antiquities Act.
This authority enabled President Theodore
Roosevelt on December 8, 1906, to issue a
proclamation establishing Petrified Forest
National Monument for the protection and
preservation of one of the world&rsquo;s most colorful
and extensive concentrations of petrified
wood &ldquo;for the benefit and enjoyment of
the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northeastern Arizona is not the only area
known to contain petrified wood, for it has
been found in nearly every State and in foreign
countries as well. Visitors from distant
States are frequently surprised to discover,
from a map in the monument&rsquo;s museum, that
petrified wood is to be found near their own
homes. It is, however, the large amount of
the wood in such beautiful and varied colors
that makes <i>this</i> Petrified Forest outstanding
and worthy of being protected as an area of
national significance.</p>
<p>We do not know for certain which of the
early travelers was the first to see the great
display of petrified wood of northern Arizona.
Spanish explorers may have seen it
during the 1500&rsquo;s, since they viewed and
named the Painted Desert (Desierto Pintado),
but no written account has been located
that gives any indication that they
noticed the wood. In fact, the earliest written
report on record was not made until 1851.
In that year, Lieutenant Sitgreaves, an Army
officer, explored parts of northern Arizona
and mentioned the petrified wood in his reports.
In 1853, an Army expedition led by
Lieutenant Whipple visited the present
monument area, camping near the Black
Forest.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1880&rsquo;s that settlement
of this part of the Arizona territory really
got under way with completion of the Santa
Fe Railroad across it in 1883. Word about
the petrified wood spread, and it was not long
until the destructive activities were started.</p>
<p>The six separate &ldquo;forests&rdquo; within the
monument are areas of the greatest concentration
of petrified logs and have been named
the First, Second, Third, Black, Rainbow, and
Blue Forests. The latter was given its name
because of the bluish color of much of the
badlands formation in which the wood is
found. There is not a great deal of difference
in the wood found in the other locations, so
they were apparently named by early residents
in order to distinguish one location
from the other.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this monument is easily accessible
since it is crossed by two main highways,
thus giving visitors to northern Arizona an
excellent opportunity to enjoy the beauties
of this unusual work of nature. The National
Park Service of the United States Department
of the Interior has been entrusted with the
responsibility of protecting and administering
this and all of the other national monuments
and parks forming America&rsquo;s National
Park System. It is the responsibility of all the
people, as owners of these outstanding national
values, to help the Service keep the
wonders of this and other parks and monuments
intact for the enjoyment of future
generations.</p>
<p>Because of the name &ldquo;Petrified Forest,&rdquo;
many people who have read of it expect to
find trees &ldquo;turned to stone&rdquo; and standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
upright just as they grew. Actually, geologists
who have studied the area very carefully do
not believe that many of the living trees
grew in this particular location, for all of the
evidence indicates that fallen timber from
forests a considerable distance away was carried
here by flood waters of ancient streams
and stranded and buried in the mud and
shallows of lagoons and marshes.</p>
<p>During the latter part of what geologists
call the Triassic period, about 160 to 170
million years ago, most of northeastern Arizona
was apparently an extensive flood plain;
low, flat, and swampy. Numerous streams,
some of them quite large, flowed out from
the surrounding low hills into the plain.
These streams brought enormous quantities
of sediments; mud, sand, and other minerals,
spreading it out layer upon layer as they
shifted their flow back and forth just as on
present river deltas. These sediments contained
huge amounts of volcanic ash which
the streams apparently picked up near their
sources. This ash was largely silica, the mineral
which was later to be of major importance
in the petrification of the wood. (Silica
(SiO&#8322;) is the oxide of silicon, a non-metallic
element making up 28 per cent of the earth&rsquo;s
crust. The crystal form of silica is quartz, the
commonest of all minerals, which is found
in large amounts in many volcanic rocks.)</p>
<p>The flood plain was broken by an occasional
ridge or high spot, apparently tree-covered,
as a few petrified stumps with partial
root systems have been found in the
locations where they apparently grew. However,
most of the trees grew in forests on the
low hills through which these rivers flowed,
anywhere from a few miles to 50 or 100 miles
or more to the west and southwest of the
present national monument. These trees died
from various causes, just as trees of our modern
times do. Fire, wind, insects, diseases,
and other causes all took their toll. Many
trees probably decayed in the forest where
they fell, but others were picked up by flood
waters and were eventually transported by
the streams to the flood plain there to become
stranded with hundreds of others and to be
covered by the sediments brought in by
the streams.</p>
<p>This transportation theory is based on
several types of evidence. In the first place,
the logs have been stripped of much of their
original roots and limbs, and practically all
of the bark has disappeared. The logs present
a worn appearance, an indication of having
received rough treatment. Also, very few
traces of cones or foliage have been located,
although the fossil remains of more than 30
species of fragile ferns, cycads, rushes, and
other plants that grew in the marshes of the
ancient flood plain have been found. The
direction of the original drainage into this
area has been established by tracing the
source of the Permian gravels which are deposited
here.</p>
<p>The deposition of these sediments over the
plain continued until a layer about 400 feet
thick was built up during the centuries. This
deposit is now known geologically as the
&ldquo;Chinle Formation.&rdquo; One of the principal
materials found in the Chinle is Bentonite,
originally a volcanic ash which the streams
brought. It has since decomposed into a clay-like
soil which is very porous and spongy
and which readily absorbs water and expands.
When becoming very wet, it turns into a
bluish mud and is washed away. Erosion of
this Bentonite and other materials deposited
with it forms the badlands area now seen on
portions of the monument and in the Painted
Desert. During the ages when the original
layers of mud, sand, and silt were being deposited,
many of the logs were washed in
and buried at various levels with this Chinle
material.</p>
<p>While all of this was slowly taking place,
the land mass over this part of the continent
was gradually subsiding. It continued to settle
during the next geological period of millions
of years, and layer after layer of sediments
were washed in and deposited on top of it.
Then during the next geological (Cretaceous)
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
period, a long arm of a sea flooded this
part of the country. Marine deposits accumulated
on the bottom of the sea until finally
the Chinle Formation containing the buried
logs was covered by 3,000 feet or more of
other deposits.</p>
<p>At the close of Cretaceous time, about 60
million years ago, uplift of the present Rocky
Mountain system commenced. The basin in
which the Petrified Forest lay buried rose
with it. This gradual rising movement has
continued intermittently nearly to the present
time.</p>
<p>This uplift brought with it the activity of
erosion which has continued through the ages
until finally almost all of the 3,000 feet of
upper layers of material have been washed
away, and the many logs, that had once been
so deeply buried, have again been exposed
on the surface; but now as hard, colorful
stone. Erosion continued to carry the soil
away from the petrified logs, exposing more
and more of them. As forces of erosion lowered
the surface of the ground little by little,
the petrified logs, too hard to be affected,
settled with it, eventually accumulating with
sections of other logs that had been buried
on a lower level. Thus, the present surface
of the ground is rather thickly covered, in
many spots, with wood that was originally
scattered through approximately the upper
100 feet of this Chinle Formation. In the
vicinity of the Rainbow and Third Forest,
at least, about 300 feet more of this formation
still remains. So far as we know, wood
is to be found throughout this entire layer.
Therefore, theoretically at least, it may be
said that 25 per cent of the petrified wood
that is here is visible on the surface, the rest
still remaining buried below.</p>
<p>Three species of trees have been found
here in petrified form. The most common
one is an Araucarian Pine (<i>Araucarioxylon
Arizonicum</i>), a primitive member of the
pine family. This species became extinct
long ago, but there are still several species of
modern Araucaria native to South America,
Australia, New Zealand, and other South
Pacific islands which are apparently very similar
to this ancient form. Some of the modern
types have been imported to this country and
are used for ornamental purposes in certain
locations in Florida and along the Pacific
coast. The most common ones are known as
the &ldquo;Monkey Puzzle Tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Norfolk Island
Pine.&rdquo; Claims made by roadside stand
operators along Highway 66 that the petrified
wood offered for sale is &ldquo;beach walnut,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cactus,&rdquo; etc., have no basis in fact.</p>
<p>Two other types of petrified wood are
found here in smaller amounts. These are
the <i>Woodworthia Arizonica</i>, a cone-bearing
tree somewhat similar to the Araucaria and
the <i>Schilderia Adamanica</i>, a tree with peculiar
radiating rays in the wood. Paleontologists
are not sure where this latter kind
belongs in systematic plant classification.
What happened during the millenniums that
the logs lay buried in their Chinle tombs?</p>
<p>How did these trees turn to stone? Most
of our text books tell us that the petrification
of wood is a replacement process. Bit by bit,
water removed wood tissue and in its place
left a mineral deposit in exactly the same
form as the original, so that when the process
had been completed there was no wood left
but in its place an exact stone duplicate. This
theory was accepted for a very long time, but
recently some scientists were not satisfied
with it because certain chemical actions that
would have to occur during such a process
were difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Just prior to 1940, several scientists investigated
the process, and from their findings
decided that the wood was not petrified by
<i>replacement</i> but by the <i>infiltration</i> of mineral-bearing
water into the wood and the deposition
of this mineral in the air spaces
within the wood tissue. This process, they
believe, continued until all of the microscopic
spaces in the wood were filled solid with this
deposit and the petrified log, composed of
98 per cent by volume of mineral deposit
and 2 per cent cellulose and lignin wood
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
tissue, was the result. The original wood
tissue acted, they think, as a framework to
hold the mineral deposit like the walls of a
building would act if the rooms and spaces
between the walls were filled in solid with
liquid concrete. This accounts for retention
of the cell structure, annual rings, and other
features of the original wood. The petrification
of wood has never been studied sufficiently,
and there are many questions for
which satisfactory answers have not yet been
advanced.</p>
<p>Although woods in different localities have
been petrified by other minerals, the most
common is silica. In the case of this petrified
wood, the silica was deposited in an agatized
non-crystalline form. The normal color of the
silica without mineral stain is a white or
gray. Sometimes small amounts of other
minerals were in the solution along with silica,
or in some cases were brought in during
the millions of years of burial as a secondary
deposit in the cracks, checks, or other openings
in the petrified or partially petrified
wood. Iron oxides in small quantities produced
the great variety of shades of red,
brown, and yellow. The black color in most
cases is due to manganese oxide or carbon.
Thus, the combination of minerals produced
a rainbow of colors in the agatized wood.</p>
<p>Whenever there were small checked places,
cracks, or hollows in the wood, we find that
they are often either filled or lined with
quartz crystals or occasionally with amethyst
crystals.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;chalcedony&rdquo; (pronounced kal-sed&acute;-nee)
is a broad one usually applied to
any compact mass of silica free of definite
color pattern, but it is also frequently used
to describe all forms of silica whether translucent
or opaque, and regardless of color.
Agate, therefore, may be considered a variegated
chalcedony. Agate is translucent and
has a definite color or pattern. Jasper is
opaque and may be either red, brown, yellow,
blue, or green in color. Quartz minerals are
harder than most types of steel, and there are
only about 30 other minerals that exceed it
in hardness. In the mineral scale of hardness,
quartz is rated at 7 and diamond, the hardest
of all, at 10. Petrified wood weighs about 166
pounds per cubic foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sawed these trees&rdquo; is one of the
questions visitors frequently ask. It is a
natural query because most of the logs are
cracked into sections, in many instances of
rather uniform length, and each broken face
is smooth enough to appear almost like a saw
cut. At first glance this does give the impression
that someone, possibly a Paul Bunyan
with an enormous diamond-toothed saw, had
cut the logs into &ldquo;stove wood&rdquo; lengths. Although
there may be some differences of
opinion about how this fracturing occurred,
the present explanation by scientists is that
most of this breakage took place during the
period of uplift of this section of the country.
The gradual movement and elevation of the
earth&rsquo;s crust caused numerous earthquakes.
The shock waves of the tremblor traveling
through the earth set up vibrations which
caused the deeply buried, brittle, petrified
logs to crack. The harmonic vibrations
created by the rhythm of the regular shock
waves caused the cracks to be rather regularly
spaced. At first these cracks were tiny, but
centuries later, after the logs were exposed
on the surface, the weathering actions and
the shifting and settling of the soil beneath
them caused the cracks to widen and eventually
the fractured sections separated. Occasionally
breakage may also occur when soil
washes out from under one end of a log and
its weight causes it to sag and crack. The
normal fracture line of this material is at
right angles to the lineal axis, and the rather
smooth face causes the broken surface to
appear much like a saw cut.</p>
<p>Polished wood sections that are exhibited
in the Rainbow Forest Museum show to best
advantage the varied color pattern of this
petrified wood. The piece is first cut with
either a diamond or carborundum saw. Then
the sawed face is ground as smooth as possible
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
on carborundum wheels of different
grits. When ground sufficiently smooth, the
final polish is given the surface with hard felt
buffing wheels and a polishing compound.
Due to the hardness of the petrified wood, it
takes about an hour to cut and polish a square
inch, hence is an expensive process. Some
of the most colorful or &ldquo;picture wood&rdquo; specimens
make very attractive and durable settings
for rings, pins, and other jewelry.</p>
<p>Fossil remains of many forms of animal
life that existed here during Triassic times
also are found in the Chinle deposits with the
petrified wood. Some parts of skeletons were
mineralized and preserved in much the same
manner as was the wood. The animals which
lived where the trees accumulated were forms
that normally inhabited muddy, marshy river
bottoms, another indication of the type of
environment here during that long-gone age.</p>
<p>Largest of these animals was the Phytosaur,
a crocodile-like reptile about 18 feet long and
weighing nearly a ton. Nostrils were located
on top of the head. These reptiles were omnivorous
feeders, and with their webbed feet
and long flattened tails were at home either
on land or in the water. The Phytosaur was
a distant relative of the Dinosaur but became
extinct before the Dinosaur reached its peak
of development.</p>
<p>Another inhabitant of the swampy lowlands
where ancient logs were stranded was
the Stegocephalian, a primitive amphibian
related to modern salamanders, or mud puppies,
but of huge size. They were heavy,
flattened creatures from six to nine feet long
and probably weighed about 500 to 600
pounds. Their legs were very short, and they
moved about by dragging themselves over
the swampy ground, probably being carnivorous
feeders. The skull was almost completely
solid and had openings only for the
nostrils, eyes, and a peculiar third eye in the
top which probably was capable of distinguishing
movement or light, but not color.</p>
<p>Several types of fishes, amphibians, and
small reptiles probably lived along the
streams and in the quiet pools of those ancient
marshes. Among them were lung-fishes
whose teeth or &ldquo;dental plates&rdquo; are now found
scattered through the badlands of the Petrified
Forest.</p>
<p>Large rushes, or horsetails, bordered the
streams and matted the swamps. Their hollow
stems grew to eight and ten inches in
diameter and 30 to 40 feet tall. At each
joint were whorls of slender branches. Large,
broad-leaved ferns formed a striking contrast
with the delicate foliage of the seed fern
types. Club mosses probably grew in small
clusters in sheltered places along the banks
of the streams and pools.</p>
<p>How different this scene of millions of
years ago was from our present-day landscape
and modern plant and animal life. The climate
must have been at least sub-tropical
then; today it is semi-arid.</p>
<p>In contrast to the plants and animals of
those Triassic times living in swamps and
marshes, we now have plants and animals
that are able to exist with a minimum of
moisture. The present ground-cover is seldom
over three or four feet high, but includes a
wide variety of plants ranging from very
small flowering herbs to the several species
of gray-foliaged salt brush and other shrubs.
With suitable moisture, the spring and fall
wildflower displays are often very showy.
The early blooms of the chimaya, phacelia,
and the large, white, evening primroses are
soon followed by desert mallow; vetch; a
small white daisy-like Fleabane; the large
yellow tulip-like flowers of the mariposa
or sego lily; and as the season advances, the
paint brush; asters; snake weed; golden aster;
rabbit brush; and many others.</p>
<p>In contrast to the sluggish reptiles and
amphibians in the Triassic, we now have the
fleet pronghorn (American Antelope); occasional
coyotes and bobcats, porcupine, prairie
dogs, rabbits, and many of the smaller rodents.
Several species of harmless snakes and
an occasional rattlesnake; slender, striped,
long-tailed race runner lizards; scaled lizards,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
and the bright, green-backed, yellow-footed
Bailey Collared Lizard which frequently
brings visitors hurrying in to inquire if it
is poisonous. It isn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Several species of birds such as the Desert
Horned Larks and rock wrens make this their
permanent home while many other species
ranging in size from the tiny Allan Hummingbird
to the mighty golden eagle either
stay here during various parts of the year, or
pass through in the spring and fall migrations.</p>
<p>Intermixed with the surface deposits of
petrified wood and other remnants of the
ancient Triassic time are the much more recent
remains of early men. Ruins of their
homes, fragments of their handiwork, and
examples of their arts are to be found in
many locations.</p>
<p>These people were pre-Columbian Pueblo
Indians, ancestors of our modern Pueblo Indians,
and of the same type that inhabited
the other pueblo and cliff-dwelling sites in
the Southwest. It is probable that there was
considerable trading carried on between the
people of this area and those at other locations,
since many of the same pottery types
are found throughout.</p>
<p>This somewhat desolate region was apparently
fairly densely populated by little groups
of farming Indians. With no survey or study
of the monument area having been made,
more than 300 ruin sites have been located
and there are many others nearby. These ruins
of stone buildings are usually from one to a
few rooms in size. However, one ruin near
the Puerco River Ranger Station is estimated
to have had about 125 or more rooms. It is
built in the form of a hollow square about
180 feet by 230 feet, around a plaza about
130 by 185 feet. Probably two stories in
height, it could have housed nearly a hundred
families.</p>
<p>A study of the pottery fragments from
each site helps us to tell the approximate time
that the particular site was occupied. This
time varies from about 500 or 600 A.D. to
1400 A.D., some being used over a longer
period than others.</p>
<p>In most cases, the buildings were constructed
of pieces of sandstone, but in a few
instances the Indians had an eye for color
and used pieces of petrified wood which made
a very substantial as well as colorful building.
&ldquo;Agate House&rdquo; in the south part of the Third
Forest is one example of such construction.
This was partially reconstructed in 1934 in
the early Pueblo style by the use of chunks
of petrified wood from the heap of the ruins.
Indians also used the petrified wood for
making arrow-points and other tools and
weapons.</p>
<p>These people practiced agriculture, cultivating
corn, pumpkins, and beans. They probably
wore simple clothing made of cotton
cloth or the skins of wild animals. They also
made pottery.</p>
<p>Tree-ring studies show that there was a
great drought from 1275 to 1299 A.D. This
apparently caused a great deal of shifting
around among the Pueblo people. Only a few
villages in the Petrified Forest area were
occupied during the fourteenth century. It
is not known whether the people were driven
out by the predatory Apaches or because of
the drought.</p>
<p>Where did these Indians get water? While
there probably has not been any marked
change in climate or rainfall since that time,
there may have been more springs and seeps
along the cliffs. It is possible that these failed
during that great drought period.</p>
<p>Pottery designs of these early Indians show
an artistic talent, further indicated by the
many petroglyphs on the sandstone cliffs and
boulders throughout the area. A petroglyph
is a picture or design carved or pecked in the
face of a rock. These pictures are of figures,
geometric patterns, and symbols in many
cases similar to those found on the pottery.
Some represent hands, feet, human figures
and shapes of mammals, birds, or lizards.
These appear to be simply a collection of
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
drawings made by various Indians over a
period of time. In some cases, they were clan
symbols, each passerby adding his own much
like a visitor&rsquo;s register such as we have today
or a collection of initials or names unthinking
people carve on trees or scratch on rocks.
Unfortunately an occasional person nowadays,
thoughtless of those that follow, either
destroys this ancient art work or defaces it
by adding his name or initials to those of an
earlier man. &ldquo;Newspaper Rock&rdquo; is the most
spectacular group of petroglyphs found on
the monument.</p>
<p>Homes and tribal lands of modern Indians
are located in areas to the south, east, and
north of Petrified Forest National Monument&mdash;homes
that were established in some cases
before the first Spanish explorer entered the
Southwest.</p>
<p>To the south in the White Mountains are
the Apaches. Apparently both the Apache
and the Navajo entered the Southwest only
a short time before the Spaniards came. Being
nomads and predatory in nature, they soon
struck terror in the hearts of the peaceful
Pueblo people and caused many of them to
abandon their homes to seek more secluded
and protected sites.</p>
<p>To the east are the Zuni, a Pueblo people
that some of the early occupants of the Petrified
Forest may have joined. When the Spaniards
came, these Zuni were living in seven
pueblos that became known as the historic
&ldquo;Seven Cities of Cibola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the north are the Navajo and Hopi
peoples. Arizona&rsquo;s famous Painted Desert
forms a long curving border to the Navajo
Reservation&mdash;a border extending from near
the New Mexico line westward to the Colorado
River northwest of Cameron. A spectacular
portion of it lies in the northern part
of Petrified Forest National Monument.</p>
<p>The Painted Desert is a colorful, often
fantastically eroded badlands of Bentonitic
beds stained with shades of red, orange, yellow,
blue, purple, and brown by iron minerals.
Arid or semi-arid with only a sparse
vegetative cover, these soft beds are subject
to rapid erosion during Arizona&rsquo;s season of
torrential rains.</p>
<p>The Painted Desert formed a barrier behind
which the early Hopi people withdrew
to establish their famed mesa-top villages,
including Oraibi which has been continuously
occupied since about 350 years before
the discovery of America. These people still
live in their several mesa-top villages, their
reservation surrounded by that of the Navajo,
their former enemies, who now lead a peaceful,
semi-nomadic life.</p>
<p>There is much more to the fascinating
story of the Petrified Forest as told to us by
naturalists of the national monument. Few
visitors take time from their mad rush to
&ldquo;get somewhere quickly&rdquo; to make the effort
to understand the intricate and devious ways
of Nature, of which &ldquo;Time is the essence,&rdquo;
resulting in the spectacular and brilliant display,
this glittering jewel of the desert, the
Petrified Forest. Stopping only long enough
to marvel briefly, many of them feel the urge
to take something with them, some concrete
reminder of the colorful scene, some bits of
petrified wood. Those who successfully &ldquo;get
past&rdquo; the checking station ranger with their
illicit souvenirs usually lose these trinkets, or
find them turned to sharp goads which prod
their consciences in later years. How fortunate
those visitors who, at the expense of an
hour or so of time, gain an understanding of
what lies behind the scenery at the Petrified
Forest, thereby developing an appreciation
of the work of Nature and of God as exemplified
here. These people take with them,
not merely a souvenir, but an experience
which they will treasure and enjoy throughout
the remainder of their lives.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
